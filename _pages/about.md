I am an MPhil Student at the CS department of the The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine.
I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://hosein.tt">Professor Patrick Hosein</a> and to be part of the Trinidad and Toabgo 
Network Information Centre's <a href="http://lab.tt">TTLAB </a>initiative. 

I also read for my BSc in Computer Science at UWI, and during my time as an undergrad
worked as a research assistant under the <a href="http://sta.uwi.edu/rdifund/projects/agrinett/">AgriNeTT</a> project and interned at the NASA Ames Research
Center under the <a href="https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/">World Wind Project</a>. My undergraduate project was concerned with developing a hardware implementation
of a VQ Index Steganography technique on an FPGA.

<strong>Research Interests</strong>

My primary research interests broadly lie in the domains of Machine Learning, Data Mining, Operations Research, and Data Science. 
In particular, I focus on Graph Mining and Social Network Analysis.
